# This a level up assignment from Andela Technical Leadership Program (ATLP)
## I made this end points of crude applications calling the posts

        I have made Model called postModel that contains :
                    >> Name
                    >> Description
                    >> Phone number

        I also made a controllers that holds the logic of:
                    >> Adding new posts
                    >> Deleting new post
                    >> getting all posts
                    >> updating posts

        I mad again postRouter in routers folder to hold those Routings of my endpoints

        And finally I made this index.js to wrap them to gether and connect to the database
